Lets say that for our donations we want to use currency conversion rates that are periodically updated. In order to do this, we sign up for a 3rd party service that provides us with daily conversion rates for the 248 currencies that we support. The service is an API that outputs XML in the format:

<response>
<conversion>
<currency>JPY</currency>
<rate>0.013125</rate>
</conversion>
<conversion>
<currency>BGN</currency>
<rate>0.6707</rate>
</conversion>
<conversion>
<currency>CZK</currency>
<rate>0.05190</rate>
</conversion>

</response>
…when called with the URL https://www.rates.com/cgi-bin/xml?currency=all

Construct a PHP class that handles all of the following tasks:
* Retrieving the data from the API
* Parsing the data
* Storing it in a pre-existing mySQL table, 'exchange_rates', with 2 fields: currency, rate
* Given an amount of a foreign currency, convert it into the equivalent in US dollars. For example:
input: 'JPY 5000'
output: 'USD 65.58'
* Given an array of amounts in foreign currencies, return an array of US equivalent amounts in the same order. For example…
input: array ( 'JPY 5000', 'CZK 62.5' )
output: array( 'USD 65.58', 'USD 3.27' )
